SLIDE 3: Meet Rajesh - A Real Seller's Story
The Persona: Small Seller, Big Dreams
Rajesh runs a home appliances business on Flipkart and Amazon

Started 2 years ago from Pune
Sells kitchen appliances (mixers, grinders, air fryers)
Monthly revenue: ₹8-10 lakhs
Competes with 200+ sellers for the same products
Rajesh's Daily Struggle (Before ShelfIQ)
Morning, 6 AM: Rajesh opens 50+ browser tabs to check competitor prices manually. Takes 2 hours.

Afternoon, 2 PM: A competitor drops their mixer price. Rajesh doesn't notice until evening. Lost 15 sales.

Evening, 7 PM: Diwali is coming. Should he stock 100 or 200 units? He guesses 150. Wrong—runs out in 3 days.

Night, 11 PM: Realizes his margin dropped below cost on 3 products. Selling at a loss for 2 weeks.

Result: Stressed, reactive, losing money.

Rajesh's New Reality (With ShelfIQ)
Morning, 6 AM: ShelfIQ alert: "Competitor dropped mixer price. Recommend: Match or improve listing." Rajesh clicks "Apply." Done in 30 seconds.

Afternoon, 2 PM: ShelfIQ: "Demand spike predicted for air fryers next week. Restock now." Rajesh orders inventory confidently.

Before Diwali: ShelfIQ: "Forecast: 280 mixer units needed. Stock up by Oct 15." Rajesh stocks 280. Sells out perfectly. Zero waste.

Continuous: ShelfIQ monitors margins 24/7. Alerts before any product goes below cost.

Result: Calm, proactive, growing profitably.
